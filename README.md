# MSTcreator

This Python program allows the user to create a randomly generated set of nodes, which are then randomly connected by edges. 
After the graph is generated, the user can then select if they want to use Prim's, Kruskal's, or Sollin's algorithm to determine
the MST of each tree.

To run this program, simply type "$ python mstDriver.py" into the terminal when in the same location that all the files 
are stored in, and then follow the instructions in the program for execution.
